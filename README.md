A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT THE PROJECT:

The Hangman game project is a Python-based console game where players engage in word-guessing fun across different categories like animals, fruits, or countries, each with varying difficulty levels. Players select a category and difficulty mode, and the game randomly selects a word for them to guess. To aid in their guessing, players receive hints related to the chosen word. As players input letters, the game reveals correctly guessed ones while visually depicting the progression of a hangman for incorrect guesses. The game incorporates a finite number of attempts, represented as "lives," and players win by guessing the word correctly within these limits. If players exhaust all attempts without guessing the word, they lose the game. The project's design prioritizes modularity, enabling easy expansion and maintenance, while also implementing robust error handling to ensure smooth gameplay. Additionally, comprehensive documentation accompanies the codebase, offering clear insights into the game's mechanics and facilitating user understanding and potential contributions. Overall, the Hangman game project provides an engaging and interactive gaming experience while promoting code readability and maintainability through its structured design and documentation practices.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING THIS GAME:

(a)Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download and install Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

(b)Copy the provided code into a Python file, for example, hangman_game.py, using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or IDLE.

(c)Save the file.

(d)If you haven't already, create a Python file named hangman_stages.py and define the Hangman_stages dictionary containing ASCII art for different stages of the hangman.

(e)Save the hangman_stages.py file in the same directory as the hangman_game.py file.

(f)Open a terminal or command prompt.

(g)Navigate to the directory where you saved the hangman_game.py file.

(h)Run the game by typing python hangman_game.py and pressing Enter.

(i)Follow the on-screen instructions to select a category and difficulty mode, and then start guessing letters to uncover the hidden word.

(j)After completing a game, you'll be prompted to play again. Type "yes" to play another round or "no" to exit the game. Enjoy playing Hangman!
